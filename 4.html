	<p>Here are some quotes by <i>Albert Einstein</i>:</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/9810">
		If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.<br>
        We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.<br>
        Logic will get you from A to Z, imagination will get you everywhere.<br>
        Try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value.
    </blockquote>
